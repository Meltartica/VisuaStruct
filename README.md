# VisuaStruct
- Interactive Visualization with Data Structures & Algorithms
- Made by LBYCPA2 EQ3 Group 5

## Programming Language:
- [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html) with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)

## Java Libraries Used:
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
  - Dependency Management and Build Tool
- [JSON](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)
  - JSON (de)serialization in Java, basically writing and reading JSON files
- [JUnit Jupiter](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)
  - Testing framework for Java applications, used for writing and running tests
- [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL)
  - Game development framework for JavaFX, facilitating the creation of 2D games in Java
 
## Project Description:
- Project Goal:
  - Develop an application with a user-friendly interface for users of all ages.
  - Offer data structures and algorithms, such as stacks, queues, etc., to enhance user understanding.
  - Aim to make the learning process enjoyable and accessible.
- Application Features:
  - Use JavaFX for GUI to provide an immersive and interactive user experience.
  - Main menu allows users to choose data structures and real-world applications to explore.
  - Users can interact with and manipulate the chosen data structure and application in a specific instance.
- Educational Simulation:
  - Users gain hands-on experience with data structures through practical simulations.
  - Features include adding/deleting files, organizing into folders, and displaying the file system structure.
  - Users input commands or use a graphical interface, bridging theoretical understanding with practical application.
- Project Emphasis:
  - Not only about teaching concepts but also demonstrating efficient real-world applications.
  - Focus on helping users understand how to utilize data structures effectively.
  - To provide practical insights into applying these concepts in everyday computing tasks.
 
## Objectives
- To provide an interactive platform for users to understand and manipulate various data structures.
- To visually represent the operations of various data structures, making abstract concepts more tangible.
- To design an impressive and intuitive GUI that enhances user experience.
- To cater to different learning styles by providing a visual learning tool, thus making learning data structures more accessible.
- To encourage computational thinking by allowing users to see the immediate impact of their actions on the data structures.
- To show the users the wide range of applications of data structures that many systems use in today’s technology.
- To incorporate performance metrics to give users feedback on the efficiency of their interactions within the simulations.
- To create at least one original or customized algorithm that will be integrated into the program, which shall show the group’s understanding of the course topics.
